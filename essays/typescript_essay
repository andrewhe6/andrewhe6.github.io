TypeScript: Weird But Cool

Initial Impressions
I have recently started learning TypeScript and so far, I have mixed feelings about it. Typescript is an extension of JavaScript so I had to first learn JavaScript, which is a much weirder language than I initially thought. It could just be due to my biases as someone who has some previous background experience in Python (and Java from prior ICS classes) or the fact that I have only spent about a week with TypeScript and JavaScript but they seem to have many weird quirks that might take me a while to get used to, especially with syntax. 

TypeScript Compared to Python 
JavaScript is similar to Python in that they are both interpreted object-oriented languages. With TypeScript, however, it acts closer to Java with the enforced static typing. I love this addition because it can sometimes be hard to keep track of the datatypes of variables, especially in a dynamically-type language like Python and JavaScript. Even in my Python programs, I will import the typing module to incorporate type annotations into my code. For software engineering, things like parameter types are very useful especially when working on a project with other people. Other things might take me more time to get used to such as the arrow functions and the object definition, which is quite different from what I am used to in Python and Java. To be honest, my biggest gripe with TypeScript is that it is an extension of JavaScript, which means that it maintains a lot of the idiosyncrasies that JavaScript has, causing me to prefer Python more. Or it could just be my lack of experience with TypeScript speaking.

First WOD Experience
The practice WODs were helpful because it was my first experience coding in a timed environment using TypeScript, which I had only recently learned. Although the task was pretty easy, it was still quite stressful not only because of the timer, but also because I was not yet familiar with TypeScript syntax. I had to unlearn my habit of using Python syntax and had to look up the syntax for switch statements. Ultimately I think the style of learning that the WODs provide will be beneficial for me since it mimics coding interviews and trains me to think and find information quicker.
