Communication is an integral skill that every software engineer should develop and one way to improve communication is by asking smarter questions. StackOverflow is a popular online forum where software engineers gather to ask and answer questions. The forum contains a plethora of questions, some good and some bad. I have recently read a blog by Eric Raymond titled “How to Ask Questions the Smart Way” in which he provides excellent guidelines on how to pose effective questions to generate clearer answers. 


## What Makes a Smart Question?
An example of a SMART question that I found on StackOverflow comes from user “brad” who asks [“How do I check if an array includes a value in JavaScript?”](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/237104/how-do-i-check-if-an-array-includes-a-value-in-javascript) When I imagine a smart question, my first thought is often “a question that would stump a professional,” but I think this question is a good example of a simple, yet smart question. The user quickly lets other users know exactly what they wish to learn more about. While it may not seem like a “smart question” at first as it seems like a question that could be easily searched up to find an answer. Looking deeper into the question post however, the user includes a code snippet of a method that they already know works and wonders if there is another perhaps more efficient method of doing the same thing. They show that they have already attempted the problem themself and provided information on what they have done, indicating a desire to actually learn. 


## What Makes a Not-So-Smart Question?
An example of a Not-So-Smart question that I found on StackOverflow comes from user “I like ducks” who writes [“Minecraft Functions”](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78980417/minecraft-functions). Firstly, there is no question being asked. How are people supposed to understand what the user needs help with? Looking into the post for more details, they claim they “used a guide” but did not provide a link or any information as to what guide they followed. Without context, how can other people recreate the user’s problem to help them solve it? For all we know, they could have watched a video on Instagram on how to remove a potato from your left hand. They then go on to explain that they hope to make alchemy circles with particle effects but that “it doesn’t seem to work” without any further elaboration as to what exactly does not work. Overall, the post is full of vague statements that “things don’t work” and probably no one will ever know why because there is not even enough information provided to understand what the user’s error even is. 


## Why Ask Smart Questions?
Hopefully with the two example questions above, you can clearly see why it is important to learn how to ask a question the smart way. A question that clearly states your problem, your attempted solution(s), and other related information will go a long way in helping other people understand what you need help with and be able to actually provide the assistance required. A vague question on the other hand just leads to a long back-and-forth of asking a hundred different follow-up questions just to finally figure out what the actual problem is. Smarter questions lead to more effective solutions, less time wasted, and satisfactory results for both parties.
