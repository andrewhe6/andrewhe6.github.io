## 
I grew up addicted to video games. It started with a GameBoy Advanced, then a DSi, then a 3DS, then 2 different iPads, then a laptop, and finally a Nintendo Switch. Although I rarely have enough time for games nowadays, I still consider them as the source of my love for software and the reason I decided to major in Computer Science. I still have fond memories of watching videos on the different types of glitches in the Pokemon games. It was how I learned about doing specific movements can activate the infamous Void Glitch, allowing the player to bypass large chunks of terrain, or that dealing too much damage at once can result in weird behavior due to integer overflow. It was so interesting to learn how buggy programs could be and made me more curious as to how it functioned as a whole. How does it know to move the character when I press certain buttons? How does it know to not move my character when I press those same buttons while on a menu screen? How can the program save the game and allow me to maintain my progress even after I turn off the device?

## Shaky Start
After learning that Minecraft was coded in Java, I decided to try teach myself using online resources. It did not go so well at first because I had ZERO clue what I was doing. I kept confusing Java with JavaScript and all the online material went straight past my head. I felt so lost that I had given up for a while but my curiosity would not let me give up. I began learning Python through an app called Sololearn, which is quite similar to Duolingo with a daily streak incentive that made it easier for me to learn every day. Soon after, I began taking AP Computer Science Principles where I got a more formal understanding of various computer science topics. Despite having a rough start with programming, I love the way it challenges me in problem solving and abstract thinking. APCSP gave me the freedom to create relatively complex projects that I found fun. 

## Now What?
Despite enjoying the challenges and various topics in computer science, I did not really know what to do with all my knowledge. I was learning for the sake of learning and did not have a specific goal in mind, which I do not think is inherently a bad thing, but I often find it hard to answer any questions about my future career.
