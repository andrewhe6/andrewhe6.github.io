## 
I grew up addicted to video games. It started with a GameBoy Advanced, then a DSi, then a 3DS, which was superseded by 2 different iPads, then a laptop, and finally a Nintendo Switch. Although I rarely have enough time for games nowadays, I still attribute them as the source of my love of software. I still have fond memories of watching videos on the different types of glitches in the Pokemon games. It was how I learned about doing specific movements can activate the infamous Void Glitch, allowing the player to bypass large chunks of terrain, or that dealing too much damage at once can result in weird behavior due to integer overflow.
