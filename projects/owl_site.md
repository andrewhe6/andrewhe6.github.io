summary: "A simple website that provides information about owls in Hawai'i."

## About
This project was my final project for my AP Computer Science Principles class where we had to create a website on any topic of our choosing using HTML and CSS. I decided to base my site around the different species of owls that live in Hawai'i since I was already learning about owls in another class. The site provides information on the 4 (now 3) different species of owls, including a general overview, history, and current conservation efforts. 

## My Role
I was responsible for the entire code, design, and research for the site. I also included a list of sources that I used. 

## What I Learned
This was my first project using HTML and CSS and it lowered the barrier to web development for me. It was my first time dealing with the look and feel of a web page and having to focus on the user experience. I also learned some pretty interesting facts about owls!
